# Noise Inc

Noise Inc is a specialist independent record shop which has an online catalogue of records. Customers are the able to express interest in these records on the site. The site has an admin area (username is Admin@yahoo.com and password is 123) where new records can be added and meta data can be viewed for online transactions. For this project, I learnt PHP and file handling using JSON.
